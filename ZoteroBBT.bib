  abstract = {Over the last decade, optimizing energy storage has become significantly important in the field of energy conversion and sustainability. As a result of immense progress in the field, cost-effective and high performance batteries are imperative to meeting the future demand of sustainability. Currently, the best performing batteries are lithium-ion based, but limited lithium (Li) resources make research into alternatives essential. In recent years, the performance of aluminium-ion batteries has improved remarkably in all battery-relevant metrics, which renders them a promising alternative. Compared with monovalent Li-ion batteries, aluminium (Al) cations can carry three positive charges, which could result in higher energy densities. This review describes recent developments in Al-based cathode materials. The major goal of this review is to highlight strengths and weaknesses of various different approaches and provide guidelines for future research.},
