  abstract = {Over the last decade, optimizing energy storage has become significantly important in the field of energy conversion and sustainability. As a result of immense progress in the field, cost-effective and high performance batteries are imperative to meeting the future demand of sustainability. Currently, the best performing batteries are lithium-ion based, but limited lithium (Li) resources make research into alternatives essential. In recent years, the performance of aluminium-ion batteries has improved remarkably in all battery-relevant metrics, which renders them a promising alternative. Compared with monovalent Li-ion batteries, aluminium (Al) cations can carry three positive charges, which could result in higher energy densities. This review describes recent developments in Al-based cathode materials. The major goal of this review is to highlight strengths and weaknesses of various different approaches and provide guidelines for future research.},

The development of increasingly safe battery systems requires continued improvements in cell thermal stability as well as new pack and vehicle designs with rigorous and redundant safety controls. There are many advanced materials being developed and characterized in industry, universities, and national laboratories for Li ion batteries. These materials are often developed primarily for improved performance such as energy density, specific energy, power capability, low temperature response, cycle lifetime, and cost. Safety is often a property determined after the development phase. Safety and thermal stability should become a prime consideration in the initial development and material selection process. There is certainly no need for a ``safe'' battery that does not perform but also there is no need for a high performance battery that is unsafe.},

However, the narrow electrochemical stability window (about 1.23 V) of the aqueous electrolyte sets a limit on their energy output. Herein, we have developed an aqueous rechargeable hybrid battery using Na2MnFe(CN)6 nanocubes as the cathode and a zinc metal sheet as the anode, which delivered a high energy density of 170 W h kg-1 and a capacity retention of 75\% over 2000 cycles with an operating voltage of up to 2.0 V. By adding sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to the aqueous electrolyte, the electrochemical stability window of the electrolyte was expanded to about 2.5 V. The results of the experiments and calculations based on the density functional theory indicate that SDS can not only inhibit the decomposition of water, suppress the dissolution of Mn and the corrosion of zinc but also increase the cycle life and rate capability. The low-cost, high energy density, and long cycle life of the battery suggest that it is a promising candidate for energy storage applications.},

  abstract = {Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZ) solid electrolyte is one of the promising electrolytes for all-solid-state battery due to its high Li ion conductivity and stability against Li metal anode. However, high calcination temperature for LLZ preparation promotes formation of La2Zr2O7 impurity phase. In this paper, an effect of Al2O3 addition as sintering additive on LLZ solid electrolyte preparation and electrochemical properties of Al2O3-added LLZ were examined. By the Al2O3 addition, sintered LLZ pellet could be obtained after 1000\textdegree{}C calcination, which is 230\textdegree{}C lower than that without Al2O3 addition. Chemical and electrochemical properties of the Al2O3-added LLZ, such as stability against Li metal and ion conductivity, were comparable with the LLZ without Al2O3 addition, i.e. {$\sigma$}bulk and {$\sigma$}total were 2.4\texttimes{}10-4 and 1.4\texttimes{}10-4Scm-1 at 30\textdegree{}C, respectively. All-solid-state battery with Li/Al2O3-added LLZ/LiCoO2 configuration was fabricated and its electrochemical properties were tested. In cyclic voltammogram, clear redox peaks were observed, indicating that the all-solid-state battery with Li metal anode was successfully operated. The redox peaks were still observed even after one year storage of the all-solid-state battery in the Ar-filled globe-box. It can be inferred that the Al2O3-added LLZ electrolyte would be a promising candidate for all-solid-state battery because of facile preparation by the Al2O3 addition, relatively high Li ion conductivity, and good stability against Li metal and LiCoO2 cathode.},

Electrochemical contact with the micro-saline and oil phases in a BME is alternately or simultaneously achieved by controlling the hydrophilicity and lipophilicity of the electrode surfaces.

The individual electrodes in the batteries have been examined using XRD, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and SEM. The results show that the Nyquist plots of commercial lithium-ion batteries are comprised of an inductive tail at high frequency followed by two semicircles at medium and low frequencies. The size of the semicircles at low frequency increase during cycling due to the increase in interfacial resistances of both cathode and anode. Thus, it may be used to predict the cycle life of the battery. XRD, TEM and SEM studies of the individual electrodes show that the cation disorder, microcracks of the LiCoO2 particles in the cathode and the increase in thickness of the passive film on the anode due to the reduction of the electrolyte are linked to the capacity fade of the battery during cycling.},

Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in microemulsions and micellar solutions is incorporated to form micelles within the cationic films. This changes the net film charge from positive, characteristic of the protonated lysines, to negative, characteristic of SDS micelles. Micelle formation was supported by voltammetry and quartz crystal microbalance results, which also suggested that cationic surfactants do not enter the film. Catalytic turnover rates for the reduction of dibromocyclohexane to cyclohexene mediated by the film in SDS microemulsions were controlled by the difference between the reduction potential of the reactant and the catalyst E\textdegree{}` in the film. Thus, reaction rate in these systems is controlled by the intrinsic activation free energy. For a given reactant, catalyst E\textdegree{}`, and consequently activation free energy, can be controlled by microemulsion composition via interactions of surfactant and salt with the polymer network. Fast catalyst turnover was also facilitated by high conductivity and low viscosity of the bulk microemulsion.},

The electrode|fluid interface in microemulsions probably consists of a dynamic layer of surfactant molecules packed more loosely on the electrode than in aqueous micellar solutions. Microemulsions afforded good yields of carbon\textendash{}carbon addition products in reactions mediated by the cobalt complex vitamin B12.

  abstract = {Electrolysis in microemulsions is a promising approach for environmentally friendly chemical synthetic methods of the future. Employing microemulsions instead of organic solvents for electrosynthesis has the advantages of lower toxicity and cost, high dissolving power for reactants and mediators of unlike solubility, enhancement of reaction rates by controlling the reduction potentials of mediators, possible reaction pathway control, and recycling of microemulsion components. This paper reviews recent progress in using microemulsions for direct and mediated electrosynthesis, including formation of carbon\-carbon bonds. Rates of mediated reactions can be controlled by manipulating microemulsion composition. Examples are presented, in which reaction pathways of direct and mediated electrolyses can be controlled with microemulsions to give desired products in high yields. Such control has been demonstrated with dissolved and surface-bound mediators. For a covalently linked scaffold of poly(l-lysine) and cobalt corrin vitamin B12 hexacarboxylate attached to graphite, catalytic turnover rate for reduction of 1,2-dibromocylcohexane was optimized by optimizing microemulsion composition.},

  abstract = {Suppression of a co-intercalation reaction into a graphite negative electrode is an important issue to use propylene carbonate (PC) as a base electrolyte solvent in lithium-ion batteries. In order to suppress the co-intercalation reaction, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme) was added to the PC-based electrolyte solution. Interfacial reactions at the graphite negative electrodes were investigated by an in-situ scanning probe microscope (SPM) observation and an in-situ Raman spectroscopy to elucidate effects of diglyme in the PC-based electrolyte solution. Reversible intercalation and de-intercalation reactions of lithium ion took place in the PC-based electrolyte solution by adding small amount of diglyme (PC:diglyme = 20:1, vol. ratio). Based on the results of in-situ SPM and in-situ Raman spectroscopy, it is found that diglyme-solvated lithium ion preferentially intercalated and decomposed within the graphite and form a surface film. This surface film lowered the co-intercalation reaction potential of PC-solvated lithium ion, and co-intercalated PC-solvated lithium ion was easily decomposed within the graphite and then formed the effective surface film on the graphite surface.},

  abstract = {A concentrated effort for battery safety
Aqueous electrolytes are limited to run below 1.23 V to avoid degradation. Suo et al. smash through this limit with an aqueous salt solution containing lithium (Li) bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide to create an electrolyte that has an electrochemical window of 3 V (see the Perspective by Smith and Dunn). They used extremely high-concentration solutions, which suppressed hydrogen evolution and electrode oxidation. At these concentrations, the Li solvation shell changes because there simply is not enough water to neutralize the Li+ charge. Thus, flammable organic electrolytes could potentially be replaced with a safer aqueous alternative.
Science, this issue p. 938; see also p. 918
Lithium-ion batteries raise safety, environmental, and cost concerns, which mostly arise from their nonaqueous electrolytes. The use of aqueous alternatives is limited by their narrow electrochemical stability window (1.23 volts), which sets an intrinsic limit on the practical voltage and energy output. We report a highly concentrated aqueous electrolyte whose window was expanded to \textasciitilde{}3.0 volts with the formation of an electrode-electrolyte interphase. A full lithium-ion battery of 2.3 volts using such an aqueous electrolyte was demonstrated to cycle up to 1000 times, with nearly 100\% coulombic efficiency at both low (0.15 C) and high (4.5 C) discharge and charge rates.
The electrochemical stability window of an aqueous electrolyte is expanded to 3 volts. [Also see Perspective by Smith and Dunn]

The sodium-ion water-in-salt electrolyte (NaWiSE) eliminates this barrier by offering a 2.5 V window through suppressing hydrogen evolution on anode with the formation of a Na+-conducting solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) and reducing the overall electrochemical activity of water on cathode. A full aqueous Na-ion battery constructed on Na0.66[Mn0.66Ti0.34]O2 as cathode and NaTi2(PO4)3 as anode exhibits superior performance at both low and high rates, as exemplified by extraordinarily high Coulombic efficiency ({$>$}99.2\%) at a low rate (0.2 C) for {$>$}350 cycles, and excellent cycling stability with negligible capacity losses (0.006\% per cycle) at a high rate (1 C) for {$>$}1200 cycles. Molecular modeling reveals some key differences between Li-ion and Na-ion WiSE, and identifies a more pronounced ion aggregation with frequent contacts between the sodium cation and fluorine of anion in the latter as one main factor responsible for the formation of a dense SEI at lower salt concentration than its Li cousin.},

Eighteen local minima were located that correspond to coordination of Li+ with one to four oxygens. The binding energies of the complexes increase with coordination of Li+ by oxygen, although the binding per Li-O bond decreases. The potential energy surfaces for lithium cation migration between one- and two-coordination sites and two- and three-coordination sites in the Li+-diglyme complexes were investigated, and five transition states were located. While the barriers are small (less than 2 kcal/mol) for lithium cation migration from lower to higher coordination, the barriers are large (20-30 kcal/mol) for higher to lower coordination. The latter corresponds to the barrier for transfer of Li+ from one end of diglyme to the other and is approximately the difference in binding energy of the higher and lower coordination structures. The implications for Li+ migration along a single polymer chain in lithium-poly(ethylene oxide) are discussed.},

Improvement of lifetime has also to be achieved under the float-charging condition. We have been developing large-capacity Li-ion cells of which safety are improved by adding phosphazene flame retardant. In this work, 200-Ahs cell is fabricated and several safety tests under the assumption of telecommunications backup use are carried out. The results show no explosion, ignition, or thermal runaway. Forced thermal runaway test of a cell in the module which involves 13 cells are also carried out. There is no explosion, ignition, or thermal runaway in other 12 cells. In addition, 36-kW Li-ion battery system consisted of the 200-Ahs cells and battery management system (BMS). The system was operated for about 400 days in a state of floating charge.

  abstract = {The level of complexity with which any biological ion interaction mechanism can be investigated, whether it is a binding mechanism in proteins or a permeation mechanism in ion channels, is invariably limited by the state-of-the-art of our understanding of the characteristic properties of ion solvation. Currently, our understanding of the energetic properties of ion solvation in aqueous phase is considered adequate enough to have helped us obtain satisfactory descriptions of the role of energetics in several biological ion interaction processes. In contrast, the lack of consensus among all the experimental structural hydration data determined more than 10~years ago, particularly regarding ion hydration numbers, has limited us to nothing better than speculation regarding the roles of local spatial environments in these mechanisms. Here we revisit experimental and theoretical work applied to probe hydration numbers of three alkali metal ions, Li+, Na+ and K+, and analyze them to clarify the current state-of-the-art of our understanding of their structural hydration properties. We find that with substantial improvements over the past 10~years in areas of experimental techniques, data analysis strategies, and theoretical and computational approaches for interrogating ion hydration structures, there is now growing consensus regarding the hydration numbers of these ions. We see that under physiological conditions, ab initio methods suggest that all three ions prefer strong coordination with exactly 4 water molecules, a result we find consistent with some older experimental measurements. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations invariably identify additional ``loosely'' coordinated water molecules at the far slopes of the principle maxima of the radial distribution profiles for Na+ and K+ ions. We suggest that these statistical admixtures of additional oxygen atoms have resulted in the most recent experimentally determined hydration numbers of Na+ ions to be 5 and K+ ions to be 6.},

Here we exhaustively evaluate NaPF6 in diglyme as an electrolyte of choice, via both physicochemical properties and extensive electrochemical tests including half as well as full cells. Fundamentally, the ionic conductivity is found to be quite comparable to carbonate based electrolytes and to obey the fractional Walden rule with viscosity. We find Na metal to work well as a reference electrode and the electrochemical stability, evaluated potentiostatically for various electrodes and corroborated by DFT calculations, to be satisfactory in the entire voltage range 0\textendash{}4.4 V. Galvanostatic cycling at C/10 of half and full cells using Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) or Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) as cathodes and hard carbon (HC) as anodes indicates rapid capacity fading in cells with HC anodes, possibly originating in a lack of a stable SEI or by trapping of sodium. Aiming to understand this capacity fade further, we conducted a GC/MS analysis to determine electrolyte reduction products and to propose reduction pathways, concluding that oligomer and/or alkoxide formation is possible. Overall, the promising results should warrant further investigations of diglyme based electrolytes for modern SIB development, albeit avoiding HC anodes.},

At 20\textdegree{}C, these cells deliver 8.7\textendash{}6.8Wh of energy when discharged at a power range of 1\textendash{}12W between 2.5 and 4.2V. Ragone plots show that the effect of discharge power on the energy is significantly increased with decreasing of the temperature. For example, energy of the cell is entirely lost when the temperature downs to -10\textdegree{}C and the discharge rate still remains at 10W. Impedance analyses indicate that the total cell resistance (Rcell) is mainly contributed by the bulk resistance (Rb, including electric contact resistance and electrolytic ionic conductivity), solid electrolyte interface resistance (Rsei), and charge-transfer resistance (Rct). Individual contribution of these three resistances to the cell resistance is greatly varied with the temperature. Near room temperature, the Rb occupies up to half of the cell resistance, which means that the rate performance of the cell could be improved by modifying cell design such as employing electrolyte with higher ionic conductivity and enhancing electric contact of the active material particles. At low temperature, the Rct, which is believed to reflect cell reaction kinetics, dominates the cell resistance. In addition, galvanosatic cycling tests indicate that the charge and discharge processes have nearly same kinetics. The performance discrepancy observed during charging and discharging, especially at low temperatures, can be attributed to these two factors of: (1) substantially higher Rct at the discharged state than at the charged state; (2) asymmetric voltage limits pre-determined for the charge and discharge processes.},
